# Internet Programming Class

This is a full collection of my assignments for Internet Programming including the project. The project itself was quite hectic since there were very vauge instructions that the instructor himself apologized for, which was quite nice.

In the end, the project and all of the assignments taught me a lot and were a breath of fresh air since so many of the previous works that I had to complete in university were offline despite us living in an ever-increasing internet connected age. I value what I learned in this call a lot.
