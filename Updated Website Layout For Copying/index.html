              This is the new homepage and the about me page.<br><br>
              I decided to completely redo the website layout because my previous website was not scaling properly on different displays. This website heavily makes use of CSS Flexboxes.<br><br>
              My name is Nawal Ahmed, I am a fourth year student at Kennesaw State University majoring in Computer Science set to graduate this coming Fall semester. I currently intern at a banking company and help make programs that automate certain tasks. It is a great internship so far and I hope to get an actual job in that company soon. I have a variety of interests in computer related fields especially automation that can help make our lives easier. Some of the interests include networking, UNIX systems, scripting, and other back-end development operations. Aside from that, my hobbies are cooking, reading, and traveling.<br><br>
